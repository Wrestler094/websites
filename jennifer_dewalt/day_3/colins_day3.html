		<p>The following are my notes/observations about what Jen DeWalt did to complete her page:</p><br>
		<ol>
			<li>She does not actually use a button for the "click me" box.  She uses a div and then styles it.</li>
			<li>The random color generator simply produces a hexadecimal color.  Her function is as follows: "Math.random().toString(16).slice(2,8)"</li>
			<ol>
				<li>Math.random() => produces a random number between 0 and 1</li>
				<li>toString => converts the number into a string (as I am assuming the hexadecimal color can only be entered as a string).  Also, by placing 16 in the parentheses, it returns a hexidecimal representation of the number.</li>
				<li>slice(x,y) => returns a part of the string starting at the character with index "x" and then stopping at and NOT including the "yth" character.</li>
			</ol>
			<li>The button itself has an href attribute assigned to "javascript:void(0);".  That script is the smallest script that evaluates to 'undefined' which prevents Javascript from loading a new page.  There are some good articles on that at <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1291942/what-does-javascriptvoid0-mean">Stack Overflow</a> and <a href="http://www.tizag.com/javascriptT/javascriptvoid.php">Tizag</a>.</li>
			<li>It looks like she is using JQuery for the rest of her function in 'random_background.js'.  Here are my initial impressions which I will then try to validate later.  The following comments are based on her function shown here:</li>
			<p>$("#button").on("click", function () { <br>
		&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp$('body').css('background', randomColor()); <br>
	});</p><br>
			<ol>
				<li>"#button" is the id of her anchor tag that says "Click me!"</li>
				<li>JQuery appears to do events similar to what I've learned but breaks it up a bit.  It looks like you select the thing it should watch the event for, specify the event (i.e. click), and then tell it what to do...in this case, it's do the function.</li>
				<li>The function grabs the body and seeks to edit the css property "background" where it then puts in the randomColor() function which returns a hexadecimal value.</li>
			</ol>
			<li>As a reminder, "../" goes up one directory level.</li>

		</ol>
		<br>
		<hr>
		
		<p>Thinks to think about:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>I need to learn JQuery and compare it to how I currently understand events in Javascript.</li>
			<li>How else could I do the hexadecimal color generator?  I kind of just broke down her equation and then used hers...how would I intuitively do it and do I like my version vs. hers?</li>
